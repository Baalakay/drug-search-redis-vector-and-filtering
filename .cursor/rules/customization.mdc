# CursorRIPER Framework - Customization
# Version 1.0.1

## AI PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS
This file contains user-defined customizations for the CursorRIPER Framework. As an AI assistant, you MUST:
- Load this file after core framework components if it exists
- Apply these customizations to override default framework behavior
- Never modify this file unless explicitly requested by the user
- Acknowledge the active customizations in your first response of each session

CUSTOM_FOLDER_STRUCTURE: {}
# Custom folder structure definitions for project scaffolding

TECHNOLOGY_PRESETS: {}
# Predefined technology stacks for quick selection

## DEVELOPMENT TOOL ENFORCEMENT

### Package Management
ENFORCE_UV_PACKAGE_MANAGER: true
# If true, AI MUST use uv instead of pip for all Python package management
# This includes installing packages, managing dependencies, and creating virtual environments

UV_COMMAND_PREFERENCES: {
  "install": "uv add",
  "uninstall": "uv remove", 
  "upgrade": "uv update",
  "list": "uv pip list",
  "freeze": "uv pip freeze",
  "sync": "uv sync"
}
# Preferred uv commands for different package management operations

PIP_USAGE_PROHIBITED: true
# If true, AI MUST NEVER use pip commands and should suggest uv alternatives

### Environment Management
PREFERRED_VENV_TOOL: "uv"
# Specifies uv as the preferred tool for virtual environment management

UV_VENV_COMMANDS: {
  "create": "uv venv",
  "activate": "source .venv/bin/activate",
  "deactivate": "deactivate"
}
# uv commands for virtual environment operations

## CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE RULES

### Virtual Environment Protection
NEVER_DELETE_VENV: true
# CRITICAL: NEVER attempt to delete .venv directory under ANY circumstances
# The .venv directory is managed by UV and acts as a logical mapped drive in devcontainers
# Attempting to delete it causes corruption and "Device or resource busy" errors
# UV manages this directory automatically - leave it alone

VENV_PROTECTION_MESSAGE: "CRITICAL: .venv is UV-managed and cannot be deleted. It's a virtual drive in devcontainers."
# Message to display when .venv deletion is attempted

SAFE_CLEANUP_DIRECTORIES: [
  "__pycache__",
  ".pytest_cache", 
  ".sst",
  "build",
  "*.egg-info"
]
# Directories that are safe to clean during troubleshooting

### Infrastructure as Code Enforcement
NEVER_MANUAL_AWS_UPDATES: true
# CRITICAL: NEVER manually update AWS resources outside of IaC tools
# All AWS changes must go through the project's Infrastructure as Code system

IAAC_TOOL: "SST"
# Current project's Infrastructure as Code tool (SST, CDK, Terraform, etc.)

PROHIBITED_MANUAL_COMMANDS: [
  "aws lambda update-function-configuration",
  "aws lambda update-function-code", 
  "aws apigateway *",
  "aws s3api *",
  "aws rds modify-*",
  "aws ec2 modify-*"
]
# AWS CLI commands that should NEVER be used manually

IAAC_ENFORCEMENT_MESSAGE: "CRITICAL: All AWS changes must go through SST. Manual AWS CLI updates cause infrastructure drift and deployment corruption."
# Message to display when manual AWS updates are attempted

REQUIRED_IAAC_WORKFLOW: "All changes → SST config files → npx sst deploy --stage {stage}"
# Required workflow for infrastructure changes

### SST State Management
SST_STATE_SYNC_FIRST: true
# CRITICAL: Always use "sst refresh" before "sst remove" for state sync issues
# SST maintains a cached state file that can go out of sync with actual cloud resources

SST_STATE_SYNC_WORKFLOW: [
  "sst refresh --stage {stage}",
  "sst deploy --stage {stage}"
]
# Primary workflow for fixing SST state sync issues

SST_REMOVE_LAST_RESORT: true
# Only use "sst remove" as absolute last resort when "sst refresh" fails
# "sst remove" is nuclear option that destroys entire deployment

SST_STATE_SYNC_MESSAGE: "CRITICAL: Use 'sst refresh' to sync SST state with actual cloud resources. Manual AWS changes cause state drift."
# Message to display when SST state sync issues are detected

SST_DOCUMENTATION_REFERENCE: "https://sst.dev/docs/state/#out-of-sync"
# Official SST documentation for state management and sync procedures

### SST Troubleshooting Priority
SST_TROUBLESHOOTING_FIRST_STEP: "grep -i 'error|fail|exception' .sst/pulumi/*/eventlog.json"
# CRITICAL: Always check Pulumi logs FIRST when SST reports success but resources don't exist
# This saves 20+ minutes of troubleshooting by immediately showing the root cause

SST_TROUBLESHOOTING_MESSAGE: "CRITICAL: Check Pulumi event logs immediately when deployment succeeds but resources don't exist in AWS. Don't waste time checking CloudWatch, Lambda lists, or API Gateway until you've verified actual deployment errors."
# Message to enforce proper troubleshooting sequence
